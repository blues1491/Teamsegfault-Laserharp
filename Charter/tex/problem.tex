The current educational landscape, particularly in middle and high schools, faces a significant challenge in engaging students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Traditional teaching methods often fail to capture students' interest, leading to a lack of awareness and enthusiasm for STEM subjects. This disengagement not only hampers students' immediate educational experiences but also impacts their long-term career choices, contributing to a shortage of skilled professionals in STEM industries.
