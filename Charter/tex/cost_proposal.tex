The cost needed with this project vary depending on the inclusion of additional features. However the main expenses are due to the raspberry pi 5 and upgrading the lasers. everything else needed for the project are essential to its completion those include photo transistors and lasers. Hardware such as dials and speakers are also required unless optional extension are developed, such as midi. regardless the pi and the lasers will be the largest portion of the budget besides the probability of buying filament for the 3d printer.
