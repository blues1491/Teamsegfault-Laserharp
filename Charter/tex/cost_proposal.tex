The costs associated with this project may vary depending on the inclusion of additional conceptual features. However, the primary expenses are attributed to acquiring the Raspberry Pi 5 and upgrading the lasers. All expenditures for this project align with essential requirements. Phototransistors and lasers are pivotal components necessary for the project's functionality, while hardware such as dials and speakers are also required unless an optional extension is developed. regardless the Raspberry pi is the largest sum needed along side lasers which can be upgraded with an additional funding, regardless the lasers currently on order provide enough power for the current project. making every piece of technology purchased a justifiable purchase.
