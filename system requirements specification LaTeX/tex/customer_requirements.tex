This project aims to design and develop an innovative laser harp that serves as both an educational tool and a musical instrument. Customer requirements for this project are established to ensure the product meets the needs of its intended users, which include educational institutions, music enthusiasts, and hobbyists. These requirements outline the essential features and functionalities that the product must deliver to achieve user satisfaction and fulfill its purpose. Any changes to these requirements must be agreed upon by the project stakeholders, including the customer, sponsors, and the development team.

\subsection{Laser String Detection}
\subsubsection{Description}
The laser harp must accurately detect when a laser string is interrupted (plucked) and identify which specific string was interrupted. This detection must be reliable under various lighting conditions to ensure consistent performance during use.
