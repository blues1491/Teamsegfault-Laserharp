The packaging requirements for the laser harp project identify how the delivered product will be packaged for delivery to the end-user and how it will "look" when finished and delivered. For example, the software required for operation will be pre-loaded on the included microSD card. The product will be delivered in a single package, ensuring all components are included and protected during shipping. Some components may require user assembly, with detailed instructions provided. The device will feature company branding and a professional finish. Care is taken not to duplicate requirements found in other sections of this document.
